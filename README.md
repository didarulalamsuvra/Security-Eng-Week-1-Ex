##Task 1: What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?
I have not been a direct victim of cybercrime, but malware attacks have targeted me. To protect myself in the digital world, Iâ€™ve taken several actions, such as using unique passwords for each account and storing them in a reputable password manager. I also use up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software, along with firewall protection. Additionally, I regularly back up important data and avoid clicking on suspicious links.
